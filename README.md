# Computer vision AI with PyTorch engineering

### ⚠️🖥️⚙️ This model has the advantage of being easy to install and relatively energy efficient, and therefore being particularly suitable for on-board systems.

This model provides a configurable pipeline for classification and segmentation. It illustrates all the blocks: data, model backbone, modular heads, training loop with amp, validation, checkpoint backup, and inference and explainability functions (Simple Grad-CAM).

Lightweight LRM for Computer Vision
- Supports: classification and segmentation (modular heads)
- Dependencies: torch, torchvision, timm, albumentations, opencv-python, numpy, tqdm

```
# Install example:
pip install torch torchvision timm albumentations opencv-python tqdm
```
